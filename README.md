Designed the front-end for an email client that makes calls using several API routes to send, reply, receive, and archive emails. The app is built on a dynamic single-page-app design using Django and Javascript.

# What I learned
* Basic understanding and usage of **Promises** and **asynchronous** operations.
* Building a single-page-app using pure Javascript to understand the core concepts.
* Deeper understanding of event-listeners and their more efficient methods to implement.
